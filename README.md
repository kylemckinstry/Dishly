Dishly is a recipe management and meal-planning application designed to assist users in organising daily meals, tracking recipes, and creating efficient shopping lists based on available ingredients.â€¯ 
This was a project I worked on with two of my uni friends utilising .NET, C# and Windows Forms pulling from a recipe API (themealdb - https://www.themealdb.com/).

Users can search recipes, add them to favourites, or schedule them with a weekly meal planner.
